We are data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and would like to make decisitions (based on the data) about what types of apps our company should develope. \n",
    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the adds, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users."
